Recap!

We understand  - Ai landscape 
Prompting  =>
Art of testing  => manual testing 

here how you need to replicate the customer prompt with different techniques is the only way to test these AI application. 

To do so we need to understand different prompting techniques.

we will consider AI Tutor application as a reference project to learn prompting. 
AI Tutor  => an AI integrated chatbot which is similar to chatgpt and it is specially provide the answers to the students questions in specific subjects ( 8/9/10) => 
this AI Tutor is a tool used by school students to get immediate help to solve their questions. 

if it is the use case to you to test AI tutor application how many prompts you need to test before going to release?

1. Positive testing is required  => we will try to ask the question which can answered by AI brain. => in scope question

It is already trained to give answer.

2. Negative testing is required=> We will try to ask the question which can not answered by AI brain( if you are asking +2 subjects related questions or Btech or other subjects) out of scope question
 => not trained yet , so obviously it is not capable to answer.

3. Happy path testing is required =>  which questions or format of the questions students frequently ask. 
=> regular asks must provide accurate answer. 

4. Non happy path testing is required=> 
Tricky questions 
Funny questions 
=> biased questions 
=> unsafe questions 

=> to create a prompt or ask => we need to supply 
a. context  => 
b. example  => 
to get better accuracy  you need to supply as much as possible information to the AI. 

Prompting techniques:

1. single shot prompt : I do not provide any help to the AI with reference to context / example . 
Still expecting the answer or response from the AI brain ( LLM)

2. Few shot prompt: 
we need to give some examples 2/3 => to teach AI what is your expectations. 
=> AI learn from your prompt examples and deliver similar formatted response.

example 1 : 
example 2: 
Same pattern examples if you are providing happy path testing

suppose => if you provide example 1 to display the results in a table format 
if you are provide example 2 to display the results in bullet points format .

Now Question to AI brain  => tricky => Non happy path 

Differences between single shot prompt and few shot prompt ?
in single shot prompt we do ask direct question and check how AI is acting on the question without context and without examples?

in few shot prompt we do provide couple of example and then ask your question => so that AI will take your examples into consideration ( learn from examples ) and respond back to your question by keeping this learning in the mind and respond in the similar way.

3. context prompting or conversational prompting: 

AI brain do have temporary memory , in this memory we need to store the information about student . 
1.what kind of answer format he is expecting from the previous asks 
2.who is the customer 
3.style of the customer 
4. persona of the customer all these things in the temp memory of the AI brain . 
if you do not want the context  => you can open the new chat 

4. Role based prompting =>
5. Style based prompting => 
6. Jailbreaking prompt 
7. Prompt leaking
8. prompt injection
